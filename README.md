# Week-2-Refactored

### Description
In this project I took a complex and overworked, but working code and made it more simple and cohesive, and still completely functional. I was motivated to do this project so that I could test my skill sets and learn more about the functions of both HTML and CSS. Some of the challenges I faced while doing this project were that the original code was not organized; it follow the basic syntax structures of HTML and CSS. In reworking the code, I made everything more simple so that it could easily be read by other developers as well as non-developers. Hope you enjoy!

### Usage  
To demonstrate the code's functionality and accessibility I have included screenshots. The CSS is compatible with an endless amount of variations made to the HTML document. I have added extra sections to the content and the sidebar to demonstrate this.
